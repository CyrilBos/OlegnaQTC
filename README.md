# Olegna Quick Time Combat
Real time tactical RPG with an inspiration from MMO-rotations, designed with mobile-first in mind from the start.
Will be used as a subject for the first Godot hackathon / Game Jam at https://twitch.tv/vikfro.

Aiming for a unique gameplay. Recently discovered Healer's Quest on my livestream is quite similar.
